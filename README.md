## Demo
Note: Your app should look different, with your own styles applied, but the core functionality will be the same.

### Learning Objectives
- Use react-testing-library to test components
- Use snapshot testing for presentational components
- Use mock service worker (MSW) to mock out an API in a test
- Use css modules to manage component-level styling

### Description
This is truly a build from scratch deliverable. You will need to pick an API to get a list of things and display them on a page. Here are some free ones to get you started:

- Rick And Morty
- Avatar
- Hey Arnold!
- Futurama

**NOTE: Youâ€™re going to need to install React Router for this: npm i react-router-dom@5**

### Acceptance Criteria
- A user can view a list of items (characters, quotes, animals, etc)
- STRETCH: Add pagination to the list view
- A user can click on an item from the list to view more details about the item
- This should navigate the user to a detail view with a back button to return to the list
- Behavior tests exist for all views
- Snapshot tests exist for all components
- STRETCH: Add a home page with tests
- STRETCH: Add a header component that allows you to navigate to the home page
